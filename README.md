This repository is a collection of data I used in a nuclear physics laboratory exercise, with the goal to measure the binding energy of deuteron. The .lst files correspond to the different gamma spectra measured, namely for the neutron sources used, Cesium-137, sodium-22, and cobalt-60. The python file is a linear regression script I wrrote to calculate/plot the calibration curve. You can find the final lab report here: [add link].

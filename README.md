This repository is a collection of data I used in a nuclear physics laboratory exercise, with the goal to measure the binding energy of deuteron. The .lst files correspond to the different gamma spectra measured, namely for the neutron sources used, cesium-137, sodium-22, and cobalt-60. The calibration.py file is a linear regression script I wrrote to calculate/plot the calibration curve. The **´plot.py´** script is a general script to make plots using the data in the .lst files. You can find the final version of the lab report here: [add link].
